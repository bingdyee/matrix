/**
 * Structural Patterns describe how objects and classes can be combined to
 * form structures. We distinguish between object patterns and class patterns.
 * The difference is that class patterns describe relationships and structures
 * with the help of inheritance. Object patterns, on other hand, describe how
 * objects can be associated and aggregated to form larger, more complex
 * structures.

 *      6. Flyweight
 *      7. Proxy
